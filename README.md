# DoozAI
My university artificial intelligence class project. [Twelve Men's Morris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morabaraba) board game with
an AI agent as opponent using Minimax algorithm. The game is written in [Odin](https://odin-lang.org) programming language using
[Raylib](https://raylib.com) library for rendering stuff.

> [!WARNING]
> The AI part is not implemented yet.
